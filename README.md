## How to configure dynamically with Xresources

For many key variables, this build of `st` will look for X settings set in either `~/.Xdefaults` or `~/.Xresources`. You must run `xrdb` on one of these files to load the settings.

For example, you can define your desired fonts, transparency or colors:

```
*.font:	Liberation Mono:pixelsize=12:antialias=true:autohint=true;
*.alpha: 0.9
*.color0: #111
...
```

The `alpha` value (for transparency) goes from `0` (transparent) to `1` (opaque).

### Colors

To be clear about the color settings:

- This build will use gruvbox colors by default and as a fallback.
- If there are Xresources colors defined, those will take priority.
- But if `wal` has run in your session, its colors will take priority.

Note that when you run `wal`, it will negate the transparency of existing windows, but new windows will continue with the previously defined transparency.

## Notes on Emojis and Special Characters

If st crashes when viewing emojis, install [libxft-bgra](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/libxft-bgra/) from the AUR.

Note that some special characters may appear truncated if too wide. You might want to manually set your prefered emoji/special character font to a lower size in the `config.h` file to avoid this. By default, JoyPixels is used at a smaller size than the usual text.
